 SOME CCLXP2 INFO

 There's not much in this file. Mostly it is here to be updated and to apologize for there not being more documentation at this point in time. More things are planned in that direction, but time has not made that easy for us. This update of the set should be final though, so no scores will ever go obsolete.


 Oh, here's a list of updates applied to the set since its beta release:


#28 - Madness I
 Added a couple thin walls to fix a bust.

#39 - Yike-O-Matic
 Removed a block that was not needed after all.

#59 - Lot Of Danger
 Added water for visual effect.

#81 - Just Enough
 Changed a tile to a thin wall, making things simpler and avoiding a bust.

#95 - Checkerboard II LX
 Added gravel to avoid the possiblity of mimicking the MS bust.

105 - Yet Another Puzzle
 Added more bombs to be more in line with the original.

112 - After the Rainstorm
 Fix bust.

119 - Teeth
 Edited mechanism to not require odd step.


 A Thousand Thanks to the people who originally put together CCLP2. Now go and enjoy the levels in Lynx!
